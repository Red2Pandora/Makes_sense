# Makes_sense
A space for me to express my stupidity.<br>
I am thinking of making something of myself. I feel like I have wasted my time on minimal effort and safe games. Now I feel like I don't want half hard life. I'm gonna give more of myself. I'm not going to rush, but really feel and think of what is it I am doing. What is it that this person in me attracts to. This is not going to be easy, i already now. I have felt that waking up means taking bigger responsibility and also making tougher decisions. Well. I don't want to bring myself down just yet, so I'll stop here.

## To make sense of life
Just to understand what do I need to know and do to get what I want. Even to understand what is it that I truly want. Is it even possible.
What is reality? What matters truly?
